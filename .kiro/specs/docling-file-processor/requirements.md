# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive file processing system that allows users to upload documents (PDF, PNG, JPG) through a web interface, processes them using the Docling API, and stores the extracted text results in a database. The system includes user authentication via OAuth2-proxy, API key management for programmatic access, and webhook notifications for result delivery. The architecture follows a monorepo structure with separate backend (FastAPI), frontend (Next.js), and database (PostgreSQL) services, all containerized with Docker and including Cypress testing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files through a web interface, so that I can process documents and extract text content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a file upload component
2. WHEN a user selects a file (PDF, PNG, or JPG) THEN the system SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL add it to a processing queue
4. WHEN a file is queued THEN the system SHALL display the upload status to the user
5. IF an invalid file type is selected THEN the system SHALL display an error message
6. WHEN the queue processes a file THEN the system SHALL POST it to the Docling "Process File" API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be authenticated via OAuth2-proxy, so that my identity is verified and my files are secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL require authentication via OAuth2-proxy
2. WHEN OAuth2-proxy authenticates a user THEN it SHALL send the X-Forwarded-Email header to the application
3. WHEN the application receives the X-Forwarded-Email header THEN it SHALL identify the user by their email
4. IF no X-Forwarded-Email header is present THEN the system SHALL reject the request
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL associate their uploads and data with their identity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage API keys, so that I can integrate this service with my applications programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the API key management interface THEN the system SHALL display their existing API keys
2. WHEN a user creates a new API key THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, secure key
3. WHEN an API key is created THEN the system SHALL display it once and store a hashed version
4. WHEN a user deletes an API key THEN the system SHALL revoke access for that key
5. WHEN an API request includes a valid API key THEN the system SHALL process the request on behalf of the key owner
6. IF an invalid or revoked API key is used THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure a webhook endpoint, so that I can receive processing results automatically in my own systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses webhook settings THEN the system SHALL display their current webhook configuration
2. WHEN a user sets a webhook URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format
3. WHEN file processing completes THEN the system SHALL POST the results to the user's configured webhook endpoint
4. IF a webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN webhook delivery succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the successful delivery
6. IF no webhook is configured THEN the system SHALL only store results in the database

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application deployed as a monorepo with containerized services, so that it's easy to develop, test, and deploy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL be organized as a monorepo with separate backend, frontend, and database components
2. WHEN services are deployed THEN the backend SHALL use Python FastAPI
3. WHEN services are deployed THEN the frontend SHALL use Next.js
4. WHEN services are deployed THEN the database SHALL use PostgreSQL
5. WHEN the system is containerized THEN all services SHALL have Docker configurations
6. WHEN docker-compose is used THEN it SHALL include a testing profile for running Cypress tests

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the system works correctly across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL include Cypress end-to-end tests
2. WHEN the testing profile is used THEN docker-compose SHALL start all services including test runners
3. WHEN Cypress tests execute THEN they SHALL test the complete user workflow from upload to result retrieval
4. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL provide clear pass/fail results
5. IF tests fail THEN they SHALL provide detailed error information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my processed file results stored securely, so that I can retrieve them later and they remain associated with my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file processing completes THEN the system SHALL store the extracted text in the PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN results are stored THEN they SHALL be associated with the user who uploaded the file
3. WHEN a user queries their results THEN the system SHALL return only their own processed files
4. WHEN results are stored THEN they SHALL include metadata such as original filename, processing timestamp, and file type
5. IF database storage fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor the status of my file processing, so that I know when results are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL assign it a unique processing ID
2. WHEN processing status changes THEN the system SHALL update the status in real-time
3. WHEN a user queries processing status THEN the system SHALL return current status (queued, processing, completed, failed)
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL make results available for retrieval
5. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details to the user
